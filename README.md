# Nutrilyzer

Nutrilyzer is a full-stack nutrition analyzer built with React, Express, and MongoDB. It's designed for logging and analyzing daily meals based on user-generated food items.

## Key Features

-   **Meal Logging**: Combine food items like `oats` and `milk` to create meals such as `oatmeal`. The app calculates nutritional values for each meal.

-   **Meal Indexing**: Store meals and food items in the database for easy reuse in future logs.

-   **User Dashboard**: Simple navigation for date selection and meal logging. Especially with already indexed meals.

-   **Analytics Page**: View daily, weekly, or monthly dietary data, including macronutrients, sodium, fiber, and calorie intake.

-   **CRUD Operations**: Manage your food, meal and daily log data with create, read, update, and delete options.

## Future Development

-   **AI Integration**: Potential for AI features to suggest meals or give dietary advice based on user habits.
