# Nutrilyzer

This is a comprehensive full-stack nutrition analyzer application developed using React, Express, and MongoDB.

The application's core functionality allows users to log daily meals composed of various user-generated food items. Each food item is input with its nutritional values, sourced from standard nutrition labels. Users can create individual food items—such as `oats` with its nutritional details—and combine them to form meals. For instance, after creating `oats` and `milk`, a user can create the meal `oatmeal`, specifying the quantity of each ingredient. The app then calculates the meal's detailed nutritional profile, including calories.

The app features a user-friendly dashboard prioritizing meal logging. Additionally, it includes an analytics page providing insights into daily intake, such as macronutrient, sodium, and fiber consumption, along with total calorie count. Users have the flexibility to perform basic CRUD operations to manage their food and meal collections, simplifying the daily logging process. This feature also allows for the bulk creation of frequently consumed meals, streamlining the user experience.
